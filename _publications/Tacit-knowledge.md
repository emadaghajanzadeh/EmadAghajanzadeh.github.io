abstract: "Interest in producing goods locally again has risen. Thisleads to new challenges for companies producing locally, especiallysince they are mostly small enterprises and do not always have re-sources to adapt Industry 4.0 technologies. Therefore, collaboratingin networks can strengthen local production. We propose an onlinesystem with an underlying planning component that is supported bya large-scale language model to coordinate value chains within a net-work by utilizing the tacit production knowledge within the compa-nies. Before any type of information processing can happen, how-ever, the data – in this case, the tacit knowledge – needs to be ac-quired and formalized in such a way that is easy and quick, but alsosufﬁcient enough in detail and quality for the computer system. Tothis end, we conducted a study with 16 participants to simulate thecollection of knowledge regarding the production of four pieces offurniture by having them describe simpliﬁed production steps. Weanalyze the results and show that the use of the collaborative sys-tem has a positive effect on the soundness of resulting productionplans. In a second step, we utilize artiﬁcial intelligence methods toﬁll incomplete plans. Results and implications for future research arepresented as well."
