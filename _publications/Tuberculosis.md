abstract: "In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based method to deal with volumetric data like CT scans. The method ensembles a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) with a 3D-CNN followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN). We used this approach and its constituent to solve the task of categorizing tuberculosis type in the context of ImageCLEF 2021. Our best run ranked 4th based on the Kappa metric by reaching a value of 0.181 and 3rd based on the accuracy of 0.404. Also, it is worthy of mentioning that our obtained results were very similar to that of the third team with a Kappa of 0.190; and we had a big gap with the fifth team with a Kappa of 0.140."
