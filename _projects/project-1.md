keywords: "Multi-layer Perceptron - Kmeans - Python - Keras"
description: "This project was taken as homework in the course of Computational Intelligence. The goal of the project was to simulate the function of the Kmeans algorithm by a multi-layer perceptron and showing how the perceptron is able to compensate for the drawbacks of the Kmeans algorithm. To simulate the process of Kmeans with the perceptron, I only entered the center of each cluster into the learning phase of perceptron, and then once an epoch ended, the evaluation was done over the whole data points and clusters changed. This process was continued until the convergence (a simple threshold on the number of changes). Finally, the efficiency of the method observed was shown and investigated how the proposed combined method showed better performance."
