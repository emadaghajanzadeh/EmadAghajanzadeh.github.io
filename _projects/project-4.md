description: "It was a traffic flow prediction challenge held by Neshan. The aim of the competition was to predict the traffic flow in some days given the corresponding traffic details of some days before.  To tackle the problem, we used recurrent neural networks and eventually ranked second based on our accuracy. One of the most challenging things during the competition was to appropriately fit the data to the RNN, because there were some outliers in the training data, for instance, weekends, when the traffic flow is obviously less than other working days or there were some official holidays that needed to be considered. I personally enjoyed the process in which the features were extracted from the data and the predictions were made by the RNN."
