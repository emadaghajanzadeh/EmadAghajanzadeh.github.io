description: "Tzaar is a relatively new game, that was invented by Kris Burm and published in 2007. There is no randomness and both players know all information about the current position in the game. White player and black player take turns, white has the first turn. In the starting position, there are 30 white and 30 black pieces. Each color has pieces of three types: 6 are Tzaars, 9 are Tzarras and 15 are Totts. The most important property of this game is the high branching factor, which makes the game difficult for computers. The aim of this project was to design a strong Tzaar-playing program. To do this, first, the game was modeled, and some criteria to score each game status were proposed based on the game strategies. Secondly, some useful heuristics and alpha-beta pruning were implemented, then followed by designing a pre-defined table for the initial movements in order to optimize the first choices (technically speaking, this was done due to the fact that most players always start the game with similar choices). Finally, because of the high branching factor, a node evaluation method was used to sort the nodes before the node expansion, which helps us to only expand a proportion of nodes (depends on the computational sources) and still make feasible decisions."
