keywords: "Game Theory - Constraint Satisfaction Problem"
description: "Nonograms pictures logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. The aim of this project was to solve the game using computers. For this purpose, the game was modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). There are various methods that have been used for this problem, one of which is backtracking, the one used in this project as well. Moreover, two well-known heuristics were also used, namely, minimum remaining values (MRV) and least constraining value (LCV), which improve the efficiency of the solution. Finally, with the help of some other methods, e.x. arc consistency checking, my computer was able to solve the problem for the boards with at most 700 squares."
