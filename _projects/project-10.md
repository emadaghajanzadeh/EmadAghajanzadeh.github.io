description: "The aim of this project was to process a Windows bitmap (BMP) image file and detect letters of the Latin alphabet in the image. The first step is to learn the shape of the letters. The system goes through a learning phase where the average shape of more than 20 variations of each letter is formed. In the second step, we detect letters that require the number of rows and columns in our input image, in order to form a grid accordingly. Given a set of words as input, the system will count and show the localization of those words in the image."
