keywords: "Object Detection - Python - OpenCV"
description: "In this project, I tried to design a system to provide the facility of writing in the air. For doing this, I divided the project into some smaller steps. The first step was to capture the real-time frames and then process them in a loop, in which the outliers of the frame should be removed. In the next step, the object that was responsible for drawing was detected. For this reason, I assumed the drawing tool to be a green small object and filter the frames based on this assumption. Finally, the dots were drawn in the next frames based on the center of the place, in which the object was detected. The most challenging part of this project was obviously detection the drawing tool based on its color and shape, because its color range easily was changing according to the environment, i.e., its lighting status."
