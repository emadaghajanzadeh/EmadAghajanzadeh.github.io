description: "This project was offered by robotics laboratory of ferdowsi university of Mashhad, and its aim was to design a racing car simulator. The project was divided into four smaller parts, getting the data from the game, showing them properly to the user, solving the inverse cinematic equation of the robot, and giving the result obtained to the robot to perform appropriate movements. My contribution to the project was to do the first two steps. At first, the implementation was done on Python, but after a while, it was understood that Python can not be a good choice, due to the time consideration, which was so important in a real-time application like this. Furthermore, C++ was used successfully and the game data was obtaining from the game at a good pace. However, it was a little challenging to design a good GUI for the program using C++, because it does not have the that much good library for drawing the plots compared to Python. (up to my best knowledge)."
