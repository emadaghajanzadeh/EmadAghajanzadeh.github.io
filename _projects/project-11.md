description: "Trie tree is a type of tree data structure that is used for locating specific keys from within a set. This project was given during the data structure course, and its aim was to implement the trie tree efficiently. My final implementation was capable of storing and retrieving about 200 words in a reasonable time, less than 2 seconds (As the project had been done a long time ago, my approximation of its capacity can be much better or worse than the real one)."
