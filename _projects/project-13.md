description: "This project was given during the course of advanced programming, and its aim was to implement a game, like breaks breaker to make the students understand better the concepts of object-oriented programming. While the logic of the game was beautifully designed, enough time was not put for its appearance, unfortunately. (Although the fact that I am not really interested in designing was not effect-less)"
