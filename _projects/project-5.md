description: "This project was taken during the computational intelligence course. The aim of this project was to predict the genre of a film based on its description. For this purpose, three different approaches were used, two of which were the word2vec and tf-idf. In the third method, a combination of both former methods was used. The idea was to change the bag of words to a bag of concepts. To do this, I first performed clustering on the vectors obtained by the word2vec and replaced all synonym words in the test data with only a specific word, hence the word semantic also will be considered by the tf-idf algorithm. Finally, the superiority of the last method over the other two methods was shown."
